For this application author has used backbone + marionette as basic stack and backbone.stickit as additional plugin
for 2-ways data-binding, which is absent in Backbone

To have opportunity track request parameters and user IP Express.js was used as node server framework.
It is very useful because of it easy-route handling.

Also there were used few node modules just for better dev usage.

######### IMPLEMENTATION ##############

To track unique IP for like/dislike action i have chosen next approach:
    1.Check if action for current fork id already exists, if not - create new
    2.The fork model has such structure
    {
        id,
        like : {
            counter,
            ip : [],
        },
        dislike : {
            counter,
            ip : [],
        }
    }
So when User like a fork, it adds his ip to proper action and in case he has already disliked same fork, dislikes
 are decreased.If user with current IP has already voted status 403 will be sent to him, otherwise - status 200 with chosen action
